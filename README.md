# Overview

This is a test game using python arcade that I made to familiarize myself to the process of creating games.

The game sets you on outer space where you are traveling to an unkown destination, on the way there you encounter meteorites that if you don't destroy might end your trip short.

CONTROLS
* WASD or Arrow Keys to Move
* Left Click to Shoot
* Q to Quite
* P to Pause
